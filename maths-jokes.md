Some of my favourite maths jokes 

===============================

# Jokes everyone shouldn't know

* Why did the cat fall off the roof? Becasue its mu was not big enough
great joke
* Did you hear about the mathematician who was afraid of negative numbers? He'd stop at nothing to avoid them

* Bob the sheepdog was getting the sheep in for Farmer Fred.
  He completed his task and went bounding over to the Farmer shouting “Farmer Fred, Farmer Fred…. I chased 40 sheep in to the yard for you”.
  “40 sheep?” queries Farmer Fred. “I’ve only got 37”
  “I know” says Bob. “I rounded them up”

* Who invented the round table? Sir Cumference

* What do you call people who like tractors? Protractors
This is my least favourite, who came up with this?
